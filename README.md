operating system


Whatever you do PLEASE DO NOT BOOT FROM THIS WITH A USB AND INSTALL IT! Nothing installs, you will go right back into your original operating system

you might break your computer. (nah you can't it's impossible, unless you did something idk about)






this thing can run at like no RAM and no storage space
