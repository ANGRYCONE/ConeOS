# ConeOS

**ConeOS is a hobby GRUB project and not a functional operating system.**

**Warning:** PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BOOT OR INSTALL THIS PROJECT. It is not designed for actual use and will not install an operating system. You will simply return to your existing operating system. While it's unlikely to cause harm to your computer, experimenting with boot files always carries a slight risk if you're unsure of what you're doing.

This project is an experiment in creating a GRUB-based bootloader, exploring minimal system requirements.
